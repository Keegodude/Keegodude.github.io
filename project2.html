        <h1>Web Relational Database Using Flask and Python</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project involves the creation of a web relational database application using Flask, Python, and MySQL.
            The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database through a web interface.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Schema Design</h2>
        <p>The first task I focused on was devising a database schema that could portray a sample music service. The functionality I wanted to implement allowed
        users to create their own accounts and create playlists to store songs in. I also wanted to allow users to filter the songs in their playlist by interesting metrics.
        Based on these functionalities, I devised this database schema:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Table 1: artists</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>ArtistID: Integer, Primary Key</li>
                    <li>name: String</li>
                    <li>monthly_listeners: Integer</li>
                    <li>country: String</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Table 2: users</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>UserID: Integer, Primary Key</li>
                    <li>password: String</li>
                    <li>username: String</li>
                    <li>email_address: String</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Table 3: playlists</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>PlaylistID: Integer, Primary Key</li>
                    <li>owner_UserID: Integer, Foreign Key</li>
                    <li>playlist_name: String</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Table 4: songs</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>songID: Integer, Primary Key</li>
                    <li>song_artistID: Integer, Foreign Key</li>
                    <li>name: String</li>
                    <li>genre: String</li>
                    <li>decade: Integer</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Table 5: playlist_songs</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>PlaylistID: Integer, Primary Key(composite), Foreign Key</li>
                    <li>songID: Integer, Primary Key(composite), Foreign Key</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This schema contains all required columns to connect all objects together. Artist and song values such as genre, decade, or country could be used for filtering.</p>

        <h2>Initialization</h2>
        <p>Before implementing the app functionality, I first had to prepare the environment.</p>
        <p>To begin, I first defined a new Flask app, then created an instance of the database like so:</p>
        <img src="images/webdatabase init snippet.png" alt="db init">
        <p>A full database dump .sql file can be found in this project's GitHub repository with the CREATE statements for
        all other tables.</p>
        <p>Next, I defined a few helper functions which would make executing queries simpler:</p>
        <img src="images/webdatabase helpers.png" alt="db init">

    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Implementing CRUD functions</h2>
        <p>First, the account functionality was implemented:</p>
        <img src="images/webdatabase account functionality.png" alt="db init">
        <img src="images/webdatabase signin page.png" alt="Database Schema Image">
        <img src="images/webdatabase user registration.png" alt="Database Schema Image">
        <p>Users can create a new account which will insert their provided credentials into the MySQL db so that they can be fetched at sign in.
        Upon signing in, the user will be taken to a page listing the playlists registered to their account.</p>

        <img src="images/webdatabase playlist page.png" alt="Database Schema Image">
        <p>The user can create a new playlist, or select an existing one. They can add and remove songs from their playlists.</p>
        <img src="images/webdatabase showsongs.png" alt="Database Schema Image">
        <img src="images/webdatabase playlist songs page.png" alt="Database Schema Image">
        <img src="images/webdatabase song functionality.png" alt="Database Schema Image">


    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Implementing filtered reports</h2>
        <p>The final functionality implemented was allowing the user to filter their playlist songs based on certain attributes and generate a report.</p>
        <p>I opted to use a stored procedure to query the required values from the database.</p>
        <img src="images/webdatabase stored procedure.png" alt="Database Schema Image">
        <p>Since the query can filter on many different variables and displays
        a large amount of data, it is quite large. Storing it separately and calling it within the application makes the code much more readable.</p>
        <p>Whichever values the user specifies will impact the SQL query which queries the data to be outputted in the report.</p>

        <h2>Table Indexing and Transaction Concurrency</h2>
        <p>After all functionality was implemented, I looked into indexing on certain table columns to enhance runtimes. Based on how frequently
        certain columns appear within queries, I decided to index on Playlists.PlaylistID, SongID in 'Songs' and 'Playlist_songs', and users.UserID.
            Playlists.PlaylistID comes up often in where clauses throughout the program.
            It is used many times to show the user the data from their specific playlists out of all playlists in the database.
            SongID also comes up often but for joins. It's needed to join playlists and the songs they contain.
This is necessary for adding/deleting songs from playlists.
        </p>
        <p>To ensure that the database was as tuned to the project as it could be, I also looked into how transactions and concurrency.
            In the application, there's never any interaction between users. Users can't look at other users' playlists.
            As such, there isn't really any strict need for concurrency, as users only edit their own playlists.
            There's no risk of one user reading a playlist while the owner edits it, for example. Since this is the case,
            I wanted to have efficient runtime and as little overhead as possible while still maintaining some data integrity/consistency.
            Using a Read Committed isolation level made sense in this scenario. It has less overhead than the more strict Repeatable Read and Serializable isolation levels,
            and achieves a higher level of data consistency compared to Read Uncommitted.</p>

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>The code for this project is available on <a href="https://github.com/Keegodude/MySQL-Web-DB">GitHub</a>. The following files are included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>main.py</strong>: The main Flask application file.</li>
            <li><strong>templates/</strong>: Directory containing the HTML templates.</li>
            <li><strong>CreateReport.sql/</strong>: Stored procedure responsible for filtering for report functionality</li>
            <li><strong>musicdb_dump.sql</strong>: Creates a copy of the db used in the app.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>This project was mostly undertaken to practice with MySQL and interact with it using Python, but it could provide more
        genuine use if I were to implement the Spotify API to actually utilize real account details such as playlists.</p>
        <p>More general future tasks include enhancing the front-end and implementing passwords for user accounts to make them more secure.</p>

        <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
        <p>I gained a greater understanding in some regards that can benefit me in future projects.
            This project was my introduction to Flask and web development in general.
            I gained an understanding of routing and html design that I hadn't possessed before.
            I also reinforced my understanding of relational database design and interaction. I now have more experience with
            how Python and SQL can interact with each other.
            I hadn't ever sanitized SQL input until doing so in my implementation of C.R.U.D. functions.</p>
