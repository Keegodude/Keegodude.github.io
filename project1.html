        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Sponsored by the Purdue School of Industrial Engineering, I worked in a team of five to develop a model
            for detecting cyberattacks in sensor data from automated vehicles. Our goals were minimal runtime and at least
            90% accuracy on test data. We processed a large dataset and successfully built a model that met our expectations.
        </p>

        <h2>Initial Dataset Description</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset consists of multiple CSV files, each containing localization sensor features. Each file represents
            vehicle trajectory data over time. The dataset includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Ground truth" trajectories (unaltered vehicle movement data).</li>
            <li>Attacked trajectories (generated using the "FusionRipper" algorithm with different parameters).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Across eight routes, between 200-300 attack trajectories were generated from their respective ground truths.
            The dataset was derived from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/complex-urban-dataset/home?authuser=0">Complex Urban Dataset</a>.

        <h3>Dataset Attributes (28 features)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>time</strong>: Timestamp (seconds per row).</li>
            <li><strong>x, y, z</strong>: Longitude, latitude (radians), and height (meters).</li>
            <li><strong>utm_x, utm_y</strong>: Coordinates in UTM format.</li>
            <li><strong>ve, vn, vu</strong>: Velocity in east, north, and up directions (m/s).</li>
            <li><strong>pitch, roll, yaw</strong>: Vehicle orientation (Euler angles in radians).</li>
            <li><strong>qbn_0, qbn_1, qbn_2, qbn_3</strong>: Orientation represented as a quaternion.</li>
            <li><strong>init_align</strong>: Initial vehicle heading.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard deviations</strong>: Position, velocity, and orientation (x_sd, y_sd, yaw_sd, etc.).</li>

        <h2>Data Preparation</h2>
        <p>
            To simplify the dataset, we aggregated each CSV using mean values, reducing the dataset from over a million
            entries to 2,546 rows. We combined attack and ground truth data, labeled them, and used XGBoost's feature
            importance to retain only eight key features:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>vx_sd, z_sd</strong>: Standard deviations of x and z positions.</li>
            <li><strong>ve, vu</strong>: Velocity in the east and up directions.</li>
            <li><strong>pitch, roll, yaw</strong>: Euler angle-based vehicle orientation.</li>
            <li><strong>qbn_3</strong>: Quaternion component representing vehicle orientation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Modeling</h2>
        <p>
            We tested logistic regression, support vector machines, and XGBoost. Initially, XGBoost yielded unexpectedly
            high test metrics, leading us to investigate class imbalance.
        </p>

        <p>
            To address this, we bootstrapped additional ground truth samples. After balancing, the dataset showed
            improved performance.

        <p>
            The optimized XGBoost model successfully identified anomalies, achieving all metrics above 0.9, meeting
            our performance goal. The most impactful features in identifying cyberattacks were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Velocity standard deviations (vx_sd, z_sd)</li>
            <li>Velocity in the east and up directions (ve, vu)</li>
            <li>Vehicle orientation features (roll, qbn_3)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <p>
            Potential improvements include expanding the dataset with more real-world ground truth trajectories, reducing
            reliance on bootstrapping for class balancing.

        <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            This project reinforced my skills in data cleaning, modeling, and handling unstructured datasets.
            I also gained experience in directing team efforts, designing modeling approaches, and using XGBoost for classification.
